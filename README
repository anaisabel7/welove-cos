## README for welove_cos

This web app is meant to store quotes from songs from City Of Sound, choose one randomly every day and display it as the "quote of the day".


#### Prerequisites

For the scheduled tasks to work you will need to install the redis-server:

```
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

You need to set up the email address to send emails from. To do so, run the create_email_settings.py script that lives in the tools folder, following the example below:

```
python create_email_settings.py --email [your 'gmail' email address] --password [the password for that gmail account]
```
When deploying on a Heroku server, a manual process of setting environment variables is required instead of the above. It can be done following the example below:
```
heroku config:set EMAIL_SETTINGS_USER="[your 'gmail' email address]"

heroku config:set EMAIL_SETTINGS_PASSWORD="[the password for that gmail account]"
```
